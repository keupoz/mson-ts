## Welcome to Mson Viewer

This app is a demo of Mson port for TypeScript. [Mson](https://github.com/MineLittlePony/Mson) is a Minecraft library mod that provides a new model format and is used internally by [Mine Little Pony](https://minelittlepony-mod.com/).

### Usage

#### 3D preview

The preview supports focusing on a specific part of the model by double clicking on it. Double click on empty space of the preview to reset focus.

#### Adding custom models

You can just drag and drop the assets folder with your models. If you want to learn more about Mson format refer to its [wiki](https://github.com/MineLittlePony/Mson/wiki).
